# Code Book of run_analysis.R and the Output Tidy Data

## Source data
The codes perform analysis on the source data - UCI HAR Dataset
Url: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

## What the code performs
The code does the follows:

### Step 1: Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Download zip file into current working directory
* Unzip file and show what's inside
* Read data into R
* Merge data to create one data set

### Step 2: Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Get index of the target feature names
* Apply index to merged data set

### Step 3: Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
* Replace activity labels with corresponding activity names

### Step 4: Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
* Replace column names with meaningful feature variables
* Replace abbreviations with readable words according to features_info.txt

### Step 5: From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
* Calculate mean for each variable grouped by subject and activity
* Output new tidy data

## Output data information

### Observations
Totally 180 observations, each stands for one of the 6 activities taken by on of the 30 volunteers.

* Each volunteer is given a identifier shown as number 1-30
* List of activities:
1. WALKING
2. WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3. WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4. SITTING
5. STANDING
6. LAYING

### Variables
* The 1st variable "subject" is the identifier for 30 volunteers.
* the 2nd variable "activity" stands for 6 types of activities took by subjects.
* the 3rd to 68th variables are outcome features generated by the devices.

### Data
The data in column 3 to 68 are the mean of each corresponding subject and activity group in the source data.
